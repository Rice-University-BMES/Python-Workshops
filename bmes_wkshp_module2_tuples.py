# tuples are like lists but they are not mutable!

# why tuples? can be useful in projects where multiple people may be accessing data, to prevent
# any accidental changes

# how could you edit a tuple? you can convert to a list, edit, and convert back to a tuple!

new_tuple = tuple(old_tuple)
print(old_tuple,new_tuple)
print(old_tuple is not new_tuple) # note that this is the same object!

new_tuple = list(tuple(old_tuple))
print(old_tuple is not new_tuple)
