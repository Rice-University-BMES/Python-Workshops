# elements of lists can be changed, unlike strings
# brackets on right side of equals sign means access, brackets on left side means update
# note that good programming means homogenous lists! however, you can have different data types in a list

# List Methods

# like other python data types, there are built-in methods (aka functions) that can modify them!

# in breakout rooms, can figure out what .reverse(), .insert() do
